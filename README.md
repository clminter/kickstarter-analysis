# "An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns."
## Overview of Project 
Uncover hidden trends through data analysis of crowdfunding projects.
### Purpose
Kickstarter Campaigns focusing on theatre and musical productions throughout the world are analyzed to provide insight into common factors that determine if a production will likely be successful or will likely fail.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Anaysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

## Results
Projects launched in the month of May had the highest rate of success, while projects launched later in the summer, through the fall show a steady decline over these months until December when the failure rate and the success rate are nearly equally poor.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

## Results
Since no projects from this data set where canceled, successful and failed projects are inversely proportional. Success and failure are equally likely at several goal points: ~17000,~35000, and ~44000. Further investigation is needed to fully understand this convergence and divergence at these price points.
# Summary
## Limitations of dataset:
- only current to 2016
- no income level or age data of backers provided
## Additional Analysis required:
- Outcomes based percent pledged vs percent of goal
- Outcomes based on number of backers vs value of goal
